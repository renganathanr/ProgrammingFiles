Hi users,

Instructions of how to use and features of which this js provides:
    - Instructions:
        1. Add css and js to your html. (Note: <script> at the bottom of body),
        2. Add <body onload="queryTables()">

    - Features:
        1. will filter,
        2. will sort

    - when comes to feature it is on its development stage, bugs like after you enable and filter and disable the feature, the table does not return to its original form.
    - like in sort, the disable feature is not added, and the icons not get changed according to sorting direction.
